# wiki_hyperlink_network

In this project I am learning to visualize a network.

This is a web graph of Wikipedia hyperlinks collected in September 2011. The network was constructed by first taking the largest strongly connected component of Wikipedia, then restricting to pages in the top set of categories (those with at least 100 pages), and finally taking the largest strongly connected component of the restricted graph.
